# Login-Page-with-Shape-Animation
This project consists of index.html, script.js, and style.css, creating an interactive login page. The HTML file structures the form with username and password inputs. JavaScript handles validation, enforcing strong credentials and allowing admin login. CSS provides a modern design with animations and a sleek interface.
